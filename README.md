# ForestImpact
This project was created to use esp32 and diferent sensors to document the enviromental variables of the urban forest and compare it to a non urban forest area, we developed this project for educational purposes.

With this we strive to find if the urban forest is worth the investment for the future cities.

## Installation
This software is ready to install on every esp32 you want, but be carefull because it uses this github as an OTA(updates over the air) which means that when you change this github, you will update the code inside your esp32.
For the thingsboard you will have to change the different tokens to your own ones, be advice that showing them to the public isn't recommended if you are going to use this code in non-educational way.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
